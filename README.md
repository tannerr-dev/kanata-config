# My homerow mods
---

this is my config for the keyboard remapping sofware [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata?tab=readme-ov-file)

Goal was to move all the most used keys towards the middle of the keyboard instead of the outside, also to utilize the space bar as a layer key was a gamechanger. 

Layer One and Two are very similar with some differences though. Both move the pinky keys closer.

- Hold Layer = Base, no layer key, just hold the keys to trigger
- Layer One = move pinky keys to main fingers, space bar is layer key
- Layer Two = move the mouse, L is layer key
- Layer 3 = number layer that i dont even really use but its here
