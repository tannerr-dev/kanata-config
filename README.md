# My homerow mods

this is my config for the keyboard remapping sofware [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata?tab=readme-ov-file)

I need to redo this diagram lol, but here is a legend:
- Hold Layer = Base, no layer key, just hold the keys to trigger
- Layer One = move pinky keys to main fingers, space bar is layer key
- Layer Two = move the mouse, L is layer key
- Layer 3 = number layer that i dont even really use but its here
